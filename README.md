# Customer Churn Prediction Project

## Project Purpose
This project aims to analyze customer churn data through clustering techniques to identify patterns and segments within the customer base. By utilizing K-Means clustering, we can uncover insights that can help in predicting customer churn and enhancing customer retention strategies.

## Key Steps in Data Preparation and Modeling
1. **Data Preparation:**
   - The dataset was preprocessed to address missing values and encode categorical variables.
   - The data was split into training and testing sets to facilitate model validation.
   - Scaling techniques (StandardScaler) were applied to normalize the data.

2. **Clustering Analysis:**
   - The optimal number of clusters was determined using the elbow method.
   - A K-Means clustering model was trained on the preprocessed dataset.
   - Resulting clusters were visualized and labeled for actionable insights.
